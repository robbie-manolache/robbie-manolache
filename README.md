## About Me

Hello! My name is Robbie and I have been working as a data scientist in various domains: economic policy, energy and agriculture. I also have a PhD in financial economics, where my passion for programming, modelling and data analytics began. 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about data science and participating in Kaggle competitions. A lot of the code I've written for my personal passion projects lives right here in this GitHub repository!
