## About Me

### How I decided to become a data scientist
> TL;DR version: *Probably a typical story about a PhD grad who knows some maths, stats and coding, doesn't want to become an academic and turns to data science!*

As I was finishing my Finance PhD in late 2018, a lot of my time shifted from doing hands-on coding, analytics and modelling (the stuff I love!) to writing my thesis - a lot of proofreading, verifying citations... I also realized I should figure out what to do with my life/career, having already decided academia was not for me. I came across this [DataFramed podcast about Kaggle](https://www.datacamp.com/podcast/kaggle-and-the-future-of-data-science) and basically decided then and there data science was the way to go. To break the monotony of thesis writing, I started doing Andrew Ng's classic [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course and haven't looked back since!

### My journey in data science

Since my PhD I have been working in data science as my day job and also doing some Kaggle and extra courses on the side - which I find really fun! Here's some of the resources that I used for personal development:

#### Coursera
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - note this course uses Matlab/Octave, which was nice for me as I was coming from a Matlab background
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

#### DataCamp
* [Data Scientist with Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)
* [Big Data with PySpark Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/big-data-with-pyspark)
* I also found many of the micro-courses useful for transitioning from my PhD stack (Matlab, SAS, SQL, C++) to Python and R

#### Other
* [Kaggle's intro courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
* [Gradient Boosting by explained.ai](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/)
* [Prof Nando de Freitas's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF)

### Beyond data science

* Not much of camper, but I do like hiking out in the nature to get away from the concrete jungle
* I love board games - some of my favourites are: *Bananagrams, Dixit, Azul, Codenames, Catan, Sushi Go*
* I recently rekindled my childhood passion of playing with LEGO, buying a 2000+ piece R2-D2 set - hopefully the first of many more sets to come!
* I guess I am a foodie - I like exploring new places, especially if they have something funky and innovative on the menu. I also conduct my own R&D in the kitchen (often not very successful!)
* Regular exercise (any form of cardio) is also pretty important to me - I find it helps me focus better at work and all aspects of my life, so always try to make time for it!
